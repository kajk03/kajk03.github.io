<h1><strong> Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? </strong> </h1>

<body style="background-color: silver">
    <p><i>by William Shakespeare</i></p>
    <br>
        <p>Shall I compaare thee to a summer's day?
            <br>
            Thou art more <i>lovely</i> and more <strong>temperate</strong>:
            <br>
                Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
                <br>
                And summer's lease hath all too short a <sup>date</sup>:
         </p>

         <p>
            Sometimes too hot the eye of heaven shines,
            <br>
            And often is his gold complexion <sub>dimm'ds,</sub>
            <br>
            And evey fair from fair sometimes declines, 
            <br>
            By chance, or nature's chaging course untrimm'd:
         </p>

            <p> 
                But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
                <br>
                Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,
                <br>
                Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
                <br>
                When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,
                <br>
                So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
                <br>
                So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
